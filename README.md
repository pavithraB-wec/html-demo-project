---

## 🌟 Key Learnings

- ✅ Git initialization and configuration
- ✅ Staging, committing, and pushing code
- ✅ Adding collaborators with write access
- ✅ Working with multiple contributors on one repository
- ✅ Avoiding and resolving merge conflicts
- ✅ Writing professional README documentation
- ✅ Hosting a live website using GitHub Pages

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

> **Always `git pull` before `git push`** — prevents merge conflicts when working in a team.

> **Write meaningful commit messages** — `"feat: add navigation bar"` is far better than `"changes"`.

> **Never edit the same file simultaneously** — coordinate with your collaborator to avoid conflicts.

> **Keep your contribution graph active** — even small commits show consistent practice.

> **Add a live URL to your README** — it makes your project look complete and professional.

This project was developed as part of a **GitHub Collaboration Seminar** at:

> **Women's Engineering College, Puducherry**
> Department of Information Science & Engineering
